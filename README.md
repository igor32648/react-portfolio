This is my personal portfolio built using React.

## Features

- **Customized Design:** The portfolio includes a completely personalized template with a logo, loader, fonts, and color scheme.

- **External Packages:**
  - **EmailJS:** Utilized to send emails directly from the client-side without the need for a backend server.
  - **FortAwesome and FortAwesome Free Solid SVG Icons:** Integrated for sidebar icons and to create an animated cube on the About page.
  - **Animate.css:** Used for various animations throughout the page elements.
  - **React-Leaflet:** Displays a map with my stylized location on the Contact page.
  - **React Loaders:** Integrates the loader from [css-loaders.com](https://css-loaders.com/) into the project effortlessly.
  - **React Router DOM:** Divides the application into three main pages:
    - **Home:** Includes a brief introduction and my logo.
    - **About:** Features a presentation and a stylized cube with FortAwesome icons and Animate.css animation.
    - **Contact:** Contains a contact form using EmailJS and a map showcasing my location with React-Leaflet.
